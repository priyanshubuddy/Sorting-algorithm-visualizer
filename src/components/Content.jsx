        <h1>Welcome to Sort Visualizer!</h1>
        <p>
          Sorting algorithms are essential tools in the world of computer
          science, shaping the way data is organized and processed. At Sort
          Visualizer, we invite you to explore the fascinating world of sorting
          algorithms – the algorithms that bring order to chaos.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Sorting Algorithms?</h2>
        <p>
          Sorting algorithms are step-by-step procedures that arrange elements
          in a specific order. Whether it's arranging a list of names
          alphabetically or sorting numbers in ascending order, sorting
          algorithms provide efficient solutions to organize data for various
          applications.
        </p>
